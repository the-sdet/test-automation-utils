## Usage
Test Automation Toolkit requires Java 11 or newer.

To use Test Automation Toolkit simply add following dependency to your Maven project:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.the-sdet</groupId>
  <artifactId>test-automation-utils</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Example

This code snippet give you a glimpse of how your selenium and playwright code both can look very similar. You just need to extend SeleniumUtils.java or PlaywrightUtils.java as per your need.

Extend SeleniumUtils.java or PlaywrightUtils.java to your Page classes in Page object model and use the utility methods without working.

Depending on your usage, you can simply create an object of the SeleniumUtils.java or PlaywrightUtils.java classes and start using the utility methods.

```java
package io.github.the_sdet;

import com.microsoft.playwright.Browser;
import com.microsoft.playwright.BrowserType;
import com.microsoft.playwright.Page;
import com.microsoft.playwright.Playwright;
import io.github.the_sdet.web.PlaywrightUtils;
import io.github.the_sdet.web.SeleniumUtils;
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;

public class TestingTestAutomationToolkit {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        String url = "https://www.selenium.dev/";
        String readModeAboutSeleniumWebDriver = "//a[contains(@class,'selenium-button selenium-webdriver')]";
        String getStartedButton = "//a[contains(text(),'Getting started')]";

        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
        SeleniumUtils seleniumUtils = new SeleniumUtils(driver);
        seleniumUtils.setDefaultTimeOut(10);
        seleniumUtils.openPage(url);
        seleniumUtils.setScreenSize(1200, 700);
        seleniumUtils.maximizeScreen();
        seleniumUtils.jsClick(readModeAboutSeleniumWebDriver);
        seleniumUtils.waitAndClick(getStartedButton, 15);
        Thread.sleep(1000);
        seleniumUtils.getScreenshot();
        seleniumUtils.takeScreenshot("screenshot-by-selenium.png");
        seleniumUtils.takeFullPageScreenshot("full-screenshot-by-selenium.png");
        driver.quit();

        Playwright playwright = Playwright.create();
        Browser browser = playwright.chromium().launch(new BrowserType.LaunchOptions().setChannel("chrome").setHeadless(false));
        Page page = browser.newPage();
        PlaywrightUtils playwrightUtils = new PlaywrightUtils(page);
        playwrightUtils.setDefaultTimeOut(10);
        playwrightUtils.openPage(url);
        playwrightUtils.setScreenSize(1200, 700);
        playwrightUtils.maximizeScreen();
        playwrightUtils.jsClick(readModeAboutSeleniumWebDriver);
        playwrightUtils.waitAndClick(getStartedButton, 15);
        Thread.sleep(1000);
        playwrightUtils.takeScreenshot("screenshot-by-playwright.png");
        playwrightUtils.takeFullPageScreenshot("full-screenshot-by-playwright.png");
        page.close();
        playwright.close();
    }
}
```
